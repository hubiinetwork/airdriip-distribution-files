## Airdriip 43 of NII Note

Due to a compatibility issue between Nahmii 2.0 and existing L1 EOAs (e.g. multisig contracts), a small number of payments were made on L1. These payments include company multisig wallets.  We do not recommend that GENII tokens are held in multisig wallets, as funds may be unrecoverable when sent to the equivalent Nahmii 2.0 addresses.
