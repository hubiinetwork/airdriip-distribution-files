## Airdriips 34-37 Incentives Note

Airdriips 34-37 include an incentive payout to liquidity providers on Uniswap v3. This incentive counts for 10% of all tokens distributed, which is 100 million NII per month.

For these airdriips, 10 million of the 100 million tokens will be distributed differently. 90 million tokens will be distributed as normal, in accordance with liquidity provision, while 10 million will be held back for a second group of wallets. These wallets were deliberately excluded from the initial calculations.

The wallets identified in this second group were responsible for providing large amounts of liquidity across multiple addresses. We have limited their allocation from the airdriip as it was deemed that their strategy was overly aggressive, albeit potentially innocently. These wallets used very tight ranges when providing liquidity, sometimes across single ticks (the smallest possible price range). In at least one case, this approach was combined with token sales which pushed the market price down so that they could stay in range. The same behaviour was not seen when the price was increasing.

The effect of this adjustment is to cap the rewards gleaned by those entities and distribute the excess fairly across the other liquidity providers.

As stated in the original announcement for the incentive scheme, ‘We reserve the right to make any changes to the incentive scheme, including to wallet allocations. This is designed to prevent participants from abusing the scheme, ensuring the widest possible distribution of NII tokens as a result’. This enables us to shepherd liquidity mining, especially in the early stages of the scheme moving to Uniswap v3.

A particularly aggressive strategy can encourage others to take increased risk, but also can put off new and valued liquidity providers. We must gently discourage behaviour which can be harmful, whether malicious or innocent. As such, we will continue to monitor participation in the incentive scheme as we move towards a more automated payout mechanism using smart contracts.

The five wallets excluded from the initial calculations are listed below. We were able to demonstrate that these five wallets belonged to just two entities:
