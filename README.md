These calculations are provisional allocations and may be subject to change until the airdriip takes place.

Note: number of tokens received during the airdriip will differ from token allocation due to fees. Also note, infinitesimal rounding errors have been introduced by a library used, which will  be rectified prior to the actual airdriip
